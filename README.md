### Project Description
something i wrote:
> Sea of Paint is an experimental, narrative-driven video game where art, code, and critical inquiry intersect. Built using React, Typescript, and p5.js, the game explores issues around contemporary machine learning-based AI technology, putting into question how our ideas of memory, labor and care are brought into tension with the prevalence of data-driven AI.

the museum description:
> Sea of Paint is a narrative-driven video game that explores the issues around contemporary machine learning-based AI technology. The player engages in dialogue with a “spirit” conjured from the Sea — an ever-recording flow of data. The game asks how our ideas of memory, labor and care are brought into tension with the prevalence of data-driven AI.
